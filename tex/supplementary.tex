\item \textbf{Share Resource}
Send a proportion of the cell's stockpiled resource to a neighboring cell.
One instruction defaults to sending a large proportion of available resource (50\%) to the neighboring cell.
A second instruction defaults to sending a small proportion of available resource (5\%) to the neighboring cell.
The proportion of available resource can be adjusted by a register-based argument.
\item \textbf{Set Stockpile Sharing Reserve}
Designate a quantity of stockpiled resource as ineligible for sharing.
The amount may be modified by a register-based argument.
\item \textbf{Clear Stockpile Sharing Reserve}
Designate all stockpiled resource as eligble for sharing.
\item \textbf{Restrict Outgoing Shared Resource}
Reduce outgoing sharing efficacy.
Unsent resource is retained by the sending cell (with no resource lost).
The fraction reduced is determined by a register-based argument.
\item \textbf{Restrict Incoming Shared Resource}
Reduce incoming sharing efficacy.
Declined resource is retained by the sending cell (with no resource lost).
The fraction reduced is determined by a register-based argument.
\item \textbf{Reproduce}
Attempt to spawn a child cell in a particular direction, paid for out of the parent cell's resource stockpile.
If sufficient resource is not available in the cell's stockpile, no resource is action is taken.
Variants of this instruction are defined for each channel ID inheritance level: from endowing the daughter cell with the parental channel IDs across all levels, to endowing the daughter cell with a new level-one channel ID but the parent's level-two channel ID, to endowing the daughter cell with all-new channel IDs.
If a channel generation counter limit has been reached, reproduction is simply attempted at the next highest level; even with channel generation counters maxed out, cells may generate offspring with all-new channel IDs.
\item \textbf{Pause Reproduction}

Variants of this instruction pause reproduction at a certain wave/channel-signaling level or across all channel ID inheritance levels.

The cell is killed at the end of the current update.
\item \textbf{Designate/Revoke Heir} A dying cell's own stockpile is split evenly among neighboring cells that are designated at the time of death.
On apoptosis, 50\% of the reproduction cost to establish a cell is also split between designated neighboring cells.

A variant of this instruction is provided for each wave/channel-signaling level.
\item \textbf{Query ``Does Neighbor's Channel ID Descend From Mine?''}
